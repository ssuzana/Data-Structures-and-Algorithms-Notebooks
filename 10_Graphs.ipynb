        "# Graph Terminology\n",
        "\n",
        "* A graph is a data structure used for analyzing relationships between pairs of objects.  \n",
        "\n",
        "* A graph consists of a set *V* of *vertices* and a set $E\\subset V\\times V$ of *edges*. Vertices that are connected by an edge are called *adjacent*.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Edges can be *undirected* (like a two-way street) or *directed* (like a one-way street). For a directed edge $e=(u,v)$, the vertex $u$ is its *source*, and $v$ is its *sink*.\n",
        "\n",
        "* A *path* is a sequence of vertices. The sequence may consist of a single vertex. The *length of a path* is the number of edges it traverses. A graph is *connected* if there is a path between every pair of vertices.\n",
        "\n",
        "* A *cycle* is a path that starts and ends at the same vertex.\n",
        "An *acyclic graph* is one without cycles.\n",
        "\n",
        "* A *tree* is a type of graph, but not all graphs are trees. A tree is a connected graph without cycles.\n",
        "\n",
        "* There are two common ways to implement a graph: using an *adjacency list* or an *adjacency matrix*. \n",
        "  * In the adjacency list representation every vertex stores a list of adjacent vertices. Note that a directed edge $e=(u,v)$ would be stored twice: once in $u$'s adjacent vertices and once in $v$'s adjacent vertices.\n",
        "  * An adjacency matrix $A=(a_{i,j})$ for a graph is a square $|V|\\times |V|$ matrix in which the entry in row $i$ and column $j$ is 1 if there is an edge from vertex $i$ to vertex $j$, and 0 otherwise. This can be expressed as:\n",
        " $$a_{i,j} = \n",
        "\\begin{cases}\n",
        "1 & \\text{if there is an edge from vertex } i \\text{ to vertex } j \\\\\n",
        "0 & \\text{otherwise}\n",
        "\\end{cases}$$\n",
        "      Note that the matrix is symmetric for undirected graphs.\n",
        "      For an undirected graph, the matrix is not necessarily symmetric.\n",
